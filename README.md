# Privacy Server Map

## Overview:  

Privacy Server Map is a web application developed using [Laravel framework](https://laravel.com/). The app serves as an interface for [K-Anonymity & Differential privacy Java Server](https://github.com/Mhz95/K-anonymity-DP-Server). The basic idea of this interface is to show locations received by messages on a map, and send them to the server in order to perturb them. Finally, the perturbed locations will be shown on the map. This app helps in determining the level of privacy that the server provides for each of the implemented approaches, namely: K-anonymity, Differential privacy with Gaussian or Laplacian noise. The following shows the app interface:

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
